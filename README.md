This is a website for e-commerce.
        
## Description

In this project I set out to make a responsive and functional website for a brand called Rainy Days, which sells rain jackets for both men and women. I wanted to make a website that played on gloomy beautiful weather and a ray of sunshine which carries through the sites design. I set out to make a home page, an about page, a contact page, a page of all products, a product specific page, a checkout page and a checkout success page. I learned how to use write neat HTML, to use the DRY principle in CSS, how to make a site responsive, and how to use CSS grids and flexbox amongst many other things for a newbie. I also learned how to make my site WCAG compliant and accessible. Later I learned how to add JavaScript features and call products from my WordPress using REST API.
